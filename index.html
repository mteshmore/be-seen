      <p>The Home Project, sponsored by Pyramid Communications, is a collaborative effort across organizations, 
        individuals, and businesses. The aim of the project is to share information and resources in the fight 
        to end homelessness in King County. Our team is creating a tool for this project that allows people to 
        discover homelessness related events in King County. Organizations will be able to post new events to our 
        tool and recruit attendees, volunteers, and donors for their events. This will also serve as a resource 
        for people to learn about the organizations that are working to end homelessness in King County.</p>
